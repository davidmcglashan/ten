- game over detection
  - iterate palette and iterate each fitting x/y
- touch gestures
- dragging
  - JS robustness
  - edges
  - right-clicks

- palette
  - hide - rather than remove - the placed palette shapes
  - palette hover affordances

- drop affordances
- Colour the shapes better
- refactor the javascript into a decent shape
