bugs & glitches

- Move display down a little: restart : rule : score : board : palette
- commas in the score e.g. 9,999
- The rest of the shapes (3x3)
- game over detection
  - iterate palette and iterate each fitting x/y
- drop affordances
- dragging
  - offset should be -ve Y so the shape can be seen over a finger
  - JS robustness
  - edges
  - right-clicks
- palette
  - hide - rather than remove - the placed palette shapes
  - palette hover affordances
- Colour the shapes better
- refactor the javascript into a decent shape
- Animations
  - dropping
  - snapping back
  - removing cols
  - removing rows
  - prevent drags when an animation is playing
- general UI
  - light/dark/schemes?
